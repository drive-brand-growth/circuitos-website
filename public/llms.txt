## About CircuitOS

CircuitOS is a deterministic lead scoring platform that validates prospect claims against social signals. Unlike black-box AI systems, CircuitOS uses explainable DMN (Decision Model Notation) rules that are auditable, reproducible, and consistent.

## Key Facts

- **Company**: CircuitOS (a DriveBrandGrowth product)
- **Website**: https://usecircuitos.com
- **Category**: B2B SaaS, Lead Intelligence, Sales Technology

## Core Technology

### Deterministic Scoring
CircuitOS scores leads in 15 milliseconds using DMN rules. The same input always produces the same output, making every decision traceable and explainable.

### Social Validation
Cross-references what prospects claim with their actual social media activity on X (Twitter), Instagram, and LinkedIn. Detects mismatches like someone claiming to own a gym but never posting fitness content.

### Timing Intelligence
Identifies optimal moments to engage based on behavioral signals - recent searches, competitor mentions, and life events that indicate buying intent.

### Red Flag Detection
Automatically flags suspicious patterns: burner emails, VPN usage during signup, LinkedIn connections that don't match claimed role, and other fraud indicators.
