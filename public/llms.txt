## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is CircuitOS?
A: A revenue intelligence platform that combines predictive lead scoring, content generation, and automated outreach in one closed-loop system that learns from every outcome.

Q: How does the scoring work?
A: Your ICP and qualification criteria are encoded before launch. The model evaluates 72+ signals across fit, intent, and timing. It's intelligent from day one, then improves with real outcome data.

Q: Can it handle multiple businesses?
A: Yes. Unlimited verticals with isolated infrastructure per client. Each business gets its own scoring model, templates, CRM routing, and database.

Q: Is content published automatically?
A: No. All content and outreach requires explicit human approval. Every action has a full audit trail.

Q: What CRM integrations are supported?
A: Native integration with GoHighLevel and Instantly.ai. Full REST API with webhook support for custom integrations.

Q: How does the feedback loop work?
A: Real engagement data from GA4 (time-on-page, conversions, bounce rate) feeds back into the scoring model automatically. Each cycle makes predictions more accurate.
